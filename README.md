## Yo, I'm Hesara — but you can call me Heza ⚡

Just another dev out here messing with code like it's clay.  
From clean-ass dashboards and APIs to backend black magic and lowkey UI flex — I try it all.

Tried PHP, JS, MySQL, mobile apps, game dev, even flirted with some cursed UI/UX engines.  
Not claiming to be a legend — just here to **build stuff**, **break stuff**, and figure out **why it broke**.

Still learning. Still experimenting. Still pressing `ctrl+z` way too much.
